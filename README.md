# Note-Taker

<a name="descsection"></a>
## Description
The purpose of this project was to create a note taker application that utilizes express.js on the backend and is deployed through Heroku.  The user is prompted with a homepage that, upon button click, takes them to a note taker page where saved notes are displayed on the right hand column and a new note template is available on the left hand column. The user is able to save and delete notes.
